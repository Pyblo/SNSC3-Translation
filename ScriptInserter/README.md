# Script Inserter

Run exe and it works.
Read notes.txt for possible problems.

Reads files recursively in the 'Done JE Scripts' folder
Outputs files to 'Done I Scripts' folder

If there are problems with matching text, an output log 'nomatches.txt' is generated
It contains the file and text that was unable to be matched between I script and JE script

TAGS.csv contains all tags and what they should be replaced with
<quote> is weird so it has two entries fro replacement
<end_line> isnt there because it just gets removed, not replaced
