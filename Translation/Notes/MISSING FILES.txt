Some files do not have dialogue. Possible issue with script dumper?

1834d0c is missing a lot of dialogue
18be64c is empty. D8 explaining to gold council. Only contains 1 line, so I could probably fill it in myself
18c7d6c has misc. quests from gold council members (Ianna + Velworen), and receptionist. But only contains text for Ianna
